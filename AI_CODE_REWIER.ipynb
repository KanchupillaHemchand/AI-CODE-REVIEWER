Suggest alternative approaches that could significantly improve execution speed, especially for large datasets or computationally intensive tasks. If the performance is already good, mention it.\n",
        "Code Clarity and Readability: Evaluate the code's readability. Suggest improvements to variable names, function names, comments, and overall code structure to make it easier to understand and maintain. Point out any overly complex or confusing logic.\n",
        "Maintainability: Assess how easy it would be to modify or extend the code in the future. Suggest improvements to modularity, code organization, and the use of appropriate design patterns to enhance maintainability.\n",
        "Best Practices: Recommend the use of more idiomatic Python, standard library functions, or established coding conventions. Point out any deviations from common best practices and explain the benefits of adhering to them.\n",
        "Potential Edge Cases (If Applicable): If you notice any potential edge cases or situations where the code might not behave as expected, highlight them. This is important even if the code is generally well-written.\n",
        "Conciseness: Suggest ways to make the code more concise and efficient without sacrificing clarity. Avoid unnecessary complexity or redundancy.\n",
        "Important Instructions for the AI:\n",
        "\n",
        "Focus on constructive feedback and errors too: Frame your suggestions in a positive and helpful way. Explain the why behind your recommendations.\n",
        "Provide specific examples: Whenever possible, provide concrete code examples to illustrate your suggestions. Show the \"before\" and \"after\" to make it clear how the improvement can be implemented.\n",
        "Prioritize suggestions: If there are multiple areas for improvement, prioritize the most important ones. Focus on the changes that will have the biggest impact on performance, clarity, or maintainability.\n",
        "Be specific: Avoid vague comments like \"improve performance\" or \"make it more readable.\" Provide specific suggestions and explain the benefits.\n",
        "Consider context: Take into account the overall purpose and context of the code. A highly optimized solution might not be necessary for a small script, while it would be crucial for a large-scale application.\n",
