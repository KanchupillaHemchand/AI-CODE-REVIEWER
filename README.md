# AI Code Reviewer with Gemini

This repository contains a Streamlit application that uses the Google Gemini AI model to provide detailed reviews of Python code.  Simply paste your Python code into the text area, and the application will send it to Gemini for analysis. The AI will then return feedback focusing on areas for improvement, including:

* **Performance:** Identification of potential bottlenecks and suggestions for optimization.
* **Code Clarity:** Improvements to readability, variable names, comments, and overall structure.
* **Maintainability:** Enhancements to modularity, organization, and design patterns.
* **Best Practices:** Recommendations for adhering to idiomatic Python and coding conventions.
* **Potential Edge Cases:** Highlighting any situations where the code might not behave as expected.
* **Conciseness:** Suggestions for making the code more efficient without sacrificing clarity.
